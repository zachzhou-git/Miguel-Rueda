I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). My research interests include electoral manipulation, civil conflict, electoral systems, and political methodology. My work has been published in the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, the Journal of Politics, the Journal of Conflict Resolution, the Journal of Theoretical Politics, Political Analysis, and Political Science Research and Methods.

 

Prior to joining the Emory faculty, I was a visiting research scholar at [the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics](https://csdp.princeton.edu/) of Princeton University (2013-2014). I received my PhD in [Political Science](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/)  from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) in 2014. I also hold an M.Sc. in Economics and a B.Sc. in Economics and Mathematics from [La Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogotá, Colombia.
