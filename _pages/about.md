I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). Before joining Emory, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at Princeton University’s [Center for the Study of Democratic Politics](https://csdp.princeton.edu/) (2013–2014). I earned my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) in 2014, and I hold an M.Sc. in Economics and a B.Sc. in Economics and Mathematics from [La Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogotá, Colombia.

My research focuses on electoral accountability, political violence, and political methodology. I study how politicians circumvent formal rules to gain electoral advantages, how elected officials allocate benefits to donors and political brokers who mobilized voters in prior campaigns, and why noncombatants are sometimes deliberately targeted in civil wars. My methodological work examines the role of covariate adjustment in observational research. I employ formal theory and quantitative methods to address these questions.

My work has appeared in the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Politics*, the *British Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, the *Journal of Theoretical Politics*, *Political Analysis*, and *Political Science Research and Methods*.
